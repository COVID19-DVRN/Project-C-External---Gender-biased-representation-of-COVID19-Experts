"The Media Cloud online platform was queried for all reports pertaining to COVID-19 specific terms as follows: ["coronavirus", "ncov", "covid", "covid19", "covid-19", "covid 19"]."

"News reports were subsequently dichotomized as either citing expert opinion versus no expert opinion mentioned. “Expert” was defined via consensus among all 3 investigators to include the following: ['epidemiologist', 'virologist', 'physician', 'clinician', 'infectious disease specialist', 'infectious disease expert', 'infectious disease doctor', 'infectious diseases expert', 'infectious diseases specialist', 'infectious diseases doctor', 'clinical expert', 'medical expert', 'professor of virology', 'professor of epidemiology', 'professor of infectious disease', 'Dr.', 'Prof.', 'professor', 'Doctor', 'health inform', 'bioinform', 'Dr ', 'epidemiology professor', 'virology professor', 'infectious diseases professor', 'infectious disease professor']. These terms were considered to be relevant to the COVID-19 pandemic given their likely involvement in research and response efforts. For a report to be labeled as using expert opinion,  'says', 'said', 'explains', and  'explained,’ also had to be mentioned in conjunction with the delineation of expertise."
